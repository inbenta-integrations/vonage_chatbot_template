### OBJECTIVE
This template has been implemented in order to develop **WhatsApp** bots that consume from the Inbenta Chatbot API and Nexmo API with the minimum configuration and effort. It uses some libraries to connect the Chatbot API with Nexmo Messenger. The main library of this template is Nexmo Connector, which extends from a base library named [Chatbot API Connector](https://github.com/inbenta-integrations/chatbot_api_connector), built to be used as a base for different external services like Facebook, Skype, Line, etc.

This template includes **/conf** and **/lang** folders, which have all the configuration and translations required by the libraries, and a small file **server.php** which creates a NexmoConnectorâ€™s instance in order to handle all the incoming requests.

### FUNCTIONALITIES
This bot template inherits the functionalities from the `ChatbotConnector` library. Currently, the features provided by this application are:

* Simple answers
* Multiple options with a limit of 3 elements (without buttons, selected by text or numbered option).
* Polar questions (without buttons, selected by text or numbered option).
* Chained answers.
* Content ratings (yes/no + comment, without buttons, selected by text).
* Escalate to HyperChat after a number of no-results answers.
* Escalate to HyperChat when matching with an 'Escalation FAQ'.
* Send information to webhook through forms.
* Send a survey URL linked to the chat ticket.
* Retrieve some configuration from ExtraInfo:
    * Nexmo tokens
    * Only-chat mode configuration
    * Agents timetable
    * Label translations

>**NOTE:** WhatsApp doesn't allow displaying buttons, so **Multiple options**, **Polar questions**, **Chained answers**, **ratings** and **escalation question** will be asked without buttons, the user will select the desired option by text.

### WHATSAPP VALID MESSAGES
Due to **Nexmo API** limitations, only the following messages types are supported by the connector:
* Text
* Image
* Audio
* Video
* Files
* Static location

### INSTALLATION
It's pretty simple to get this UI working. The mandatory configuration files are included by default in `/conf/custom` to be filled in, so you have to provide the information required in these files:

* **File 'api.php'**
    Provide the API Key and API Secret of your Chatbot Instance.

* **File 'environments.php'**
    Here you can define regexes to detect `development` and `preproduction` environments. If the regexes do not match the current conditions or there isn't any regex configured, `production` environment will be assumed.

* **File 'sandbox.php'**
    If you want to use Nexmo in Sandbox mode, here you can enable/disable it and configure the Sandbox JWT and API endpoint.

#### OPTIONAL EXTRA INFO CONFIGURATION
The following settings must be set in the configuration files but optionally they can be set using Extra Info data in backstage. 
* Label translations
* Nexmo credentials (tokens)
* Only chat mode configuration
* Chat agents timetable

When new data has been set, you should publish ExtraInfo by clicking the **Post** button.

##### TRANSLATIONS
Manage the translation labels from ExtraInfo. Here are the steps to create the translations object in ExtraInfo:
* Go to **Manage groups and types -> nexmo -> Add type**. Name it `translations` and add a new property with type `Multiple` named with your Chatbot's language label (en, es, it...).
* Inside your language, add all the labels that you want to override. Each label should be a `Text`entry (you can find the labels list below).
* Save your translations object.

Now you can create the ExtraInfo object by clicking the **New entry** button, selecting the `translations` type and naming it as `translations`. Then, fill each label with your desired translation and remember to publish ExtraInfo by clicking the **Post** button.

Here you have the current labels with their English value:
* **agent_joined** => 'Agent $agentName has joined the conversation.',
* **api_timeout** => 'Please, reformulate your question.',
* **ask_rating_comment** => 'Please tell us why',
* **ask_to_escalate** => 'Do you want to start a chat with a human agent?',
* **chat_closed** => 'Chat closed',
* **creating_chat** => 'I will try to connect you with an agent. Please wait.',
* **error_creating_chat** => 'There was an error joining the chat',
* **escalation_rejected** => 'What else can I do for you?',
* **no** => 'No',
* **no_agents** => 'No agents available',
* **queue_estimation_first** => 'There is one person ahead of you.',
* **queue_estimation** => 'There are $queuePosition people ahead of you.',
* **rate_content_intro** => 'Was this answer helpful?',
* **thanks** => 'Thanks!',
* **yes** => 'Yes',
* **close_chat_key_word** => '/close',
* **out_of_time** => '_There are no agents connected_',
* **queue_warning** => 'Wait until an agent is connected before making a question.'

##### APP TOKENS
Here are the steps to create the App Tokens object in ExtraInfo:
* Go to **Manage groups and types -> nexmo -> Add type**. Name it `app_tokens` and add a new property with type `Multiple` named with your environments (development, preproduction, production).
* Inside every environment, add the tokens needed. Each field should be a `Text` entry:
  * development/preproduction/production (create one group for every environment):
    * apiKey: Your **Nexmo** Application Api Key
    * secretKey: Your **Nexmo** Application Secret Key
    * phoneNumber: Your **Nexmo** Application phone number
  * If any of your environments will be used with the sandbox mode, use these properties instead:
    * JWT: The JWT code provided by **Nexmo**
    * phoneNumber: The testing phone number provided by **Nexmo**
* Save your `app_tokens` object.

Now you can create the ExtraInfo object by clicking the **New entry** button, selecting the `app_tokens` group and naming it as `app_tokens`. Then, add and fill each environment with your credentials. Remember to publish ExtraInfo by clicking the **Post** button.

##### ONLY CHAT MODE
Here are the steps to create the `only_chat_mode` ExtraInfo object to enable/disable the only-chat mode:
* Go to **Manage groups and types -> nexmo -> Add type**. Name it `settings` and add a new property with type `Text` named with `only_chat_mode`.
* Save your translations object.

Now you can create the ExtraInfo object by clicking the **New entry** button, selecting the `settings` type and naming it as `only_chat_mode`. Then, fill it using **true** or **false** and remember to publish ExtraInfo by clicking the **Post** button.

##### AGENTS TIMETABLE
Here are the steps to create the agents timetable object in ExtraInfo:
* Go to **Manage groups and types -> nexmo -> Add type**. Name it `timetable` and add a new property with type `Multiple` named with every day of the week (monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday and sunday).
* Inside every day, add all the working periods. Each period should be a `Text`entry. 
* Save your translations object.

Now you can create the ExtraInfo object by clicking the **New entry** button, selecting the `timetable` type and naming it as `timetable`. Then, fill each day with your desired periods and remember to publish ExtraInfo by clicking the **Post** button. There is an example of how it should be set:
* monday:
  * period_1: '09:00-13:30' 
  * period_2: '15:00-18:30' 
* tuesday:
  * period_1: '09:00-18:30' 



#### FORMATTING MESSAGES
WhatsApp allow messages be formatted using special characters as you can see in the following examples:

| Format        | Symbol           | Example  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Bold            | Asterisk(*) | ```Your total is *$10.50*.``` |
| Italic          | Underscore(_)      |   ```Welcome to _WhatsApp_!``` |
| Strike-through  | Tilde(~)      |   ```This is ~better~ best!``` |
| Code | Three backticks(\```) | ``` print 'Hello World'; ``` |
| Carriage Return | \n     |    ```Hello \n World``` |

You can edit your instance contents and the extraInfo labels to use this format.

### HOW TO CUSTOMIZE
**From configuration**

For a default behavior, the only requisite is to fill the basic configuration (more information in `/conf/README.md`). There are some extra configuration parameters in the configuration files that allow you to modify the basic-behavior.


**Custom Behaviors**

If you need to customize the bot flow, you need to extend the class `NexmoConnector`, included in the `/lib/NexmoConnector` folder. You can modify 'NexmoConnector' methods and override all the parent methods from `ChatbotConnector`.

For example, when the bot is configured to escalate with an agent, a conversation in HyperChat starts. If your bot needs to use an external chat service, you should override the parent method `escalateToAgent` and set up the external service:
```php
    //Tries to start a chat with an agent with an external service
    protected function escalateToAgent()
    {
        $useExternalService = $this->conf->get('chat.useExternal');
        
        if ($useExternalService) {
            // Inform the user that the chat is being created
            $this->sendMessagesToExternal($this->buildTextMessage($this->lang->translate('creating_chat')));
            
            // Create a new instance for the external client
            $externalChat = New SomeExternalChatClass($this->conf->get('chat.externalConf'));
            $externalChat->openChat();
        } else {
            // Use the parent method to escalate to HyperChat
            parent::escalateToAgent();
        }
    }
```


**HyperChat escalation by no-result answer and negative content rating**

If your bot needs integration with HyperChat, fill the chat configuration at `/conf/conf-path/chat.php` and subscribe to the following events on your Backstage instance: `invitations:new`, `invitations:accept`, `forever:alone`, `chats:close`, `messages:new`. When subscribing to the events in Backstage, you have to point to the `/server.php` file in order to handle the events from HyperChat.

Configuration parameter `triesBeforeEscalation` sets the number of no-results answers after which the bot should escalate to an agent. Parameter `negativeRatingsBeforeEscalation` sets the number of negative ratings after which the bot should escalate to an agent.


**Escalation with FAQ**

If your bot has to escalate to HyperChat when matching a specific FAQ, the content needs to meet a few requisites:
- Dynamic setting named `ESCALATE`, non-indexable, visible, `Text` box-type with `Allow multiple objects` option checked
- In the content, add a new object to the `Escalate` setting (with the plus sign near the setting name) and type the text `TRUE`.

After a Restart Project Edit and Sync & Restart Project Live, your bot should escalate when this FAQ is matched.
Note that the `server.php` file has to be subscribed to the required HyperChat events as described in the previous section.

#### SPECIAL COMMANDS
A **key word** has been created to allow users close the chat when it has been escalated. This command can be updated from the language configuration or extraInfo labels:
* **close_chat_key_word** => '/close',

### DEPENDENCIES
This application imports `inbenta/chatbot-api-connector` as a Composer dependency, that includes `symfony/http-foundation@^3.1` and `guzzlehttp/guzzle@~6.0` as dependencies too.
Another dependency used is `spatie/opening-hours` to manage the agents timetable.

This connector is using an external library to manage the agents timetable:
